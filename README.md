🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Classification Using Pre-trained CNN Models
This project focuses on classifying rice leaf diseases using deep learning and pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset includes 5932 images of diseased rice leaves, divided into the following four categories:

Bacterial Blight
Blast
Brown Spot
Tungro
Objective
To build a multi-class image classification model that identifies the type of disease present in a rice leaf image using transfer learning techniques.

Models Used
The following pre-trained CNN architectures were used for evaluation:

Xception
VGG16
MobileNet
DenseNet121
All models were fine-tuned on the dataset, split into 80% training and 20% testing, with balanced data across all four classes.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

*Accuracy
*Precision
*Recall
*F1-Score
